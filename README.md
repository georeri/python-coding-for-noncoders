## Getting Started

Before you dive into Python development, here are some steps to help you get started:

1. **Install Python:**

   - If Python is not already installed on your computer, visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install the latest version.

2. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**

   - You can use IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write and run Python code.

3. **Set Up Git and GitHub:**
   - If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, you can follow this [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to set up your account and get acquainted with basic Git commands.

## Labs

The Labs section contains hands-on exercises and projects that gradually introduce you to Python programming concepts. These labs are designed to be beginner-friendly and provide a structured learning path.

1. [**Hello World:**](labs/lab1-hello-world.md) Learn how to write your first Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. [**Variables and Data Types:**](labs/lab2-datatypes-and-variables.md) Understand the basic data types in Python and how to use variables.

3. [**Conditional Statements:**](labs/lab3-conditional-statements.md) Learn about if-else statements for decision-making in your code.

4. [**Loops:**](labs/lab4-looping.md) Explore the concepts of for and while loops to control the flow of your programs.

5. [**Functions:**](labs/lab5-functions.md) Discover how to define and use functions in Python to make your code more modular.

6. [**Lists and Dictionaries:**](labs/lab6-lists-and-dictionaries.md) Dive into data structures like lists and dictionaries, and how to manipulate them.

7. [**File Handling:**](labs/lab7-file-handling.md) Learn how to read and write data to files using Python.

8. [**Error Handling:**](labs/lab8-error-handling.md) Understand how to handle errors and exceptions in your programs.

9. [**Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**](labs/lab9-intro-to-oop.md) Get an introduction to OOP concepts like classes and objects.

10. [**Mini Project: Progressive Refactoring:**](labs/lab10-progressive-refactoring.md) Apply what you've learned by building a simple application, and repeatedly refactor it to be increasingly modular and reusable.

## Cheatsheets

In the Cheatsheets section, you'll find quick reference guides that provide essential Python syntax and tips. These cheatsheets are handy references as you progress through your learning journey.

1. [**Python Basics Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/basics) Covers the fundamentals, such as variables, data types, and basic operations.

2. [**Control Structures Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/control-flow) Quick reference for if-else statements and loops.

3. [**Functions Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/functions) Information on defining and working with Python functions.

4. **Data Structures Cheatsheet:** A reference guide for working with [lists](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/lists-and-tuples) and [dictionaries](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/dictionaries).

5. [**File Handling Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/reading-and-writing-files) Instructions on reading and writing files in Python.

6. [**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/oop-basics) Overview of OOP concepts in Python.

7. [**Error Handling Cheatsheet:**](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/cheatsheet/exception-handling) Quick guide to dealing with exceptions and errors in your code.
