## Getting Started

Before you dive into Python development, here are some steps to help you get started:

1. **Install Python:**
   - If Python is not already installed on your computer, visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install the latest version.

2. **Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
   - You can use IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write and run Python code.

3. **Set Up Git and GitHub:**
   - If you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, you can follow this [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to set up your account and get acquainted with basic Git commands.

## Labs
