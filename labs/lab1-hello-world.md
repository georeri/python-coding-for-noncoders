# Coding for Noncoders: Your First Python Program - Hello, World!

## Introduction

In this beginner-friendly hands-on lab, you will take your first step into the world of Python programming. You'll learn how to write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This lab will provide you with a structured learning path and detailed explanations for all the code.

Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes or less.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with Python installed. If you haven't installed Python, please refer to the [official Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

## Lab Instructions

### Step 1: Open a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

You can use a simple text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or any code editor/IDE of your choice. Recommended code editors for Python include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

### Step 2: Create a New Python File

1. Open your text editor or IDE.
2. Create a new Python file with the extension `.py`. You can name it something like `hello.py`.

### Step 3: Write Your First Python Code

Now, let's write a simple Python program. In the newly created `.py` file, add the following code:

```python
# This is a comment in Python. Comments are ignored by the interpreter.

# Print "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The lines starting with `#` are comments. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are used to add explanations or notes to your code.
- `print("Hello, World!")` is a Python statement that instructs the computer to display the text "Hello, World!" on the console.

### Step 4: Run Your Python Program

Now that you've written your first Python program, let's run it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `hello.py` file is located.
3. Run your Python program by entering the following command:

```bash
python hello.py
```

You should see the following output on your console:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've successfully written and executed your first Python program.

## Conclusion

In this hands-on lab, you learned how to write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This is a fundamental starting point for your Python programming journey. You can now explore more about Python by referring to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/), where you can learn about Python's syntax, features, and capabilities.

Happy coding!
